NCAA Data Analysis Project: Understanding and Predicting Home Team Victories in NCAA Basketball

This report focuses on analyzing NCAA basketball games to predict home-team wins and explore team performances at home. The goal is to understand why some teams perform better at home and to create a model predicting home-team victories.
Our data comes from the Google Cloud public datasets in BigQuery. This dataset encompasses nearly 30,000 NCAA games from 2014 to 2017 and provides information such as venue details, team information, and team game stats.
